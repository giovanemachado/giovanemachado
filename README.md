![uma cachorrinha, chamada tralha, que mora comigo / a dog, called tralha, who lives with me](https://giovanemachado.github.io/stuff/tralha.jpeg)


<p>
    hey, I've been a fullstack engineer since 2019, and like to spend free time with my family or playing
    games.
    I live in a small town in santa catarina, brazil, and have always worked remotely.
</p>
<p>
    my professional experience includes working with startups from various fields (both in brazil and the
    usa),
    developing web and mobile applications. besides that, I'm also an aspiring game dev/designer.
