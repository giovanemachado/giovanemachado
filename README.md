# Sup?
I left the beach to find experience, I would rather rainy days and I like to solve problems.


:man_technologist: I’m currently working with:
  - NodeJS (+ Typescript)
    - Serverless
    - NextJS
  - MongoDB
  - A bunch of AWS crazy technologies
 
:books: I’m currently learning:
  - Game design (it's kind weird put this here, but you can say that I'm alone trying to create some cool games)
  - C# (for the above purposes)

:video_game: My favorite game right now is ✨ Age Of Empires IV ✨ (:medal_military: Better ranking *till now*: Undefined).
